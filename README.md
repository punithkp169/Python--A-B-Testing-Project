# Python-A/B Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting A/B testing to compare the performance of two advertising platforms—Facebook and AdWords—by analyzing clicks and conversions. The objective was to determine which platform yields better results in terms of user engagement and conversions.

## Key Concepts:
- A/B Testing: Compared the effectiveness of marketing campaigns between Facebook and AdWords.
- Hypothesis Testing: Tested the statistical significance of differences in clicks and conversions between the two platforms.
- Regression Analysis: Analyzed trends to predict the success rate based on platform performance.
- P-value & T-test: Assessed the statistical significance of the differences in clicks and conversions.
- Correlation Coefficient: Evaluated the relationship between clicks and conversions across platforms.

## Tools and Technologies:
- Python: Core programming language used for data analysis.
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical computation.

## Visualizations:
- Comprehensive visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn to compare clicks and conversions between Facebook and AdWords, highlighting key insights from the data.
